2. To view the file in the webshell, do: `$ nano fixme2.py`
3. To exit `nano`, press Ctrl and x and follow the on-screen prompts.
4. The `str_xor` function does not need to be reverse engineered for this challenge.

## Approach

This challenge is pretty similar to challenge `fixme1.py` you did.

Did you see the error? It's in line 22.
