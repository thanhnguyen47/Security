Learn about the different careers in cyber security

## Task 1: Introduction

There are many different jobs within the security industry, from **offensive pentesting** (hacking machines and reporting on vulnerabilities) to **defensive security** (defending against and investigating cyberattacks).

Why get a career in cyber:
- High Pay
- Exciting 
- Be in demand.
