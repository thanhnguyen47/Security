A **Security Operations Center (SOC)** is a team of IP security professionals tasked with monitoring a company's network and systems 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The purpose of monitoring is to:
+ Find vulnerabilities on the network
+ Detect unauthorized activity
+ Discover policy violations
+ Detect intrusions
+ Support with the incident response

## Task 2: Elements of Security Operations

### Data Sources

The SOC use many data sources to monitor the network for signs of intrusions and to detect any malicious behaviour:
+ Server logs
+ DNS Activity
+ Firewall logs
+ DHCP logs

A SOC might use **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)** system to aggregate the data from the different sources so that the SOC can efficiently correlate the data and respond to attacks.

1. Reactive services refer to the tasks initiated after detecting an intrusion or a malicious event:
+ Monitor security posture: monitoring the network and computers for security alerts and notifications and responding to them as the need dictates.
+ Vulnerabilities Management
+ Malware Analysis
+ Intrusion Detection
+ Reporting
2. Proactive services refer to tasks handled by the SOC without any indicator of an intrusion:
+ Network security monitoring
+ Threat hunting
+ Threat intelligence

### Example Scenario

SOC analyst is responsible for network security monitoring and log management.

## Task 3: Practical Example of SOC

use firewall to stop an ongoing attack
